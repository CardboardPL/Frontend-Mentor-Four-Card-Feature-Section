## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make the four card design in this project by utilizing grid to preserve my semantic structure unlike flexbox where I will need to have a container element for the middle cards so that they stack properly.

### Continued development

I plan to use this as a reference for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - This helped me relearn how to use grid again from scratch.
